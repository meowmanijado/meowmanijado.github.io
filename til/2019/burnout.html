            <p>
                A lot of happenings around these past few weeks, switching to multiple projects, teams, burden with rants around me while dealing with management issues. To be honest I quite enjoy the feeling to be needed, those things gives me somehow a purpose; but that feeling didn’t last. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One day I woke up without a desire to get back to work, at first I thought maybe it’s just for a day, my will to work will come back next day. But days past by, I found myself dragging and forcing to do the work because It had to be done. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The sense of achievement gone after those switching and jumping to different situations. Every time I write my daily scrum, I know in myself that I did not do my best though I still delivered on time but still it’s not my best.
            </p>
