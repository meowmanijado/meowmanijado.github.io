# ðŸ”¥ TIL: Hex code and Opacity

Published on February 17, 2020



When writing background color with opacity, I usually use `background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)` then I just found out that you can add to the last option of hex code the opacity using `background-color: #00000080` 

Yup, 80 is equivalent to 50% opacity. For more information https://css-tricks.com/8-digit-hex-codes/
