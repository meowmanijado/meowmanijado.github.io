# Spartan Race 2020 - WIP

Published on Feb 25, 2020



Last Saturday we conquered Spartan Race - Super (Open Category) 10km run with 25 obstacles.

**Preparation**

Since the new year start, we staterd to train hard and preparing ourselves on the race.

- Every Wednesday training at Ayala Malls Vertis North
- SGX Kalabaw every Sunday at UPD
- Vertis Training at UPD every Saturday



One week before the race we register ourselves to Pretty Huge Obstacles so that our body became familiarized by then before the actual race.

**Take aways:**

1. **It's okay to be spontaneous** - I'm always mindful with the consequences of my decisions, I even got T-charts to weigh the pros and cons then on that I will base my decision. But obviously this one doesn't go through the T-charts! it's an impulsive yes it sounds fun, I want to try that! Then I realized weeks before the race that the category we signed-up was 25 obstacles on a 10km trail.
2. **Ego check** - Week before the race, anxiety attacks me seriosuly, I always check my phone to stalk IG stories of Spartan Race PH, during commute going work or home I constantly thinking what will happen to me on the race day. As a person that enjoy doing things alone. I have this ego that I can do it on my own and I don't want to be a "pabigat" because I am a woman. 
3. **Grateful on every little things** -

After all, we've got bruises, shoulder pain and sunburnt, I surely enjoyed every seconds we had during the race. The spirit of support system, cheering one another to finish each obstacles, helping to move forward under the heat, inspite of fear of heights, lack of sleep or no proper training we still had to managed to finished without injury. All praises and glory to Him!
