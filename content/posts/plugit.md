Plug It is a co-working space & Studio hub for working professionals and university students. 

My friend Chan and ex-colleague has started a business in line of co-working space, he contacted me to
create a system to monitor their daily sales. I'm quite exited about it, this is my first time to create a real-life
system other than ToDo apps, and a successful project built in Laravel.

**Functional Requirements**
- Monitor Time In/Out of customers
- Subscriptions (Yearly, Monthly, Weekly)
- Calculate total payment
- Real-time view of current customers

**Challenges**

The challenge here was monitoring the time because the studio opens in the middle 
of the day from 12PM - 6AM.
```php

```


**Other stuff I Learned**

I have'nt experienced deploying a Laravel app before, gladly the internet is 
generous in resources, also, the app needs to be deployed locally but the thing
is Chan wants to accessed the system anywhere
```bash
php artisan serve
```

I feel like I have so many stuffs I need to improve, `eloquent` , `queries`, better model
structure and a lot more, but I'm pretty happy with the result, knowing that they actually using
it and the client is happy about it.
