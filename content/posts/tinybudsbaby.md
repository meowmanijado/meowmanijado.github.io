Tinybuds is an online shop selling natural products for babies.

This is one of the projects I am really happy and proud of. I've started to collaborate with them since 2016, I created
a eCommerce site back then using **WordPress and WooCommerce**. Early 2018 they want to transfer the shop to **Shopify**, because
they find it more user friendly and focused on selling.

I've set-up their store from the start, from store account, theme and importing the products and reviews from wordpress data.
Since then, I am the maintainer and consultant of their ecommerce store, updating the site information, products, searching
and finding a ways that can boost sales and customer experience. 

I can say that with collaboration with them, I grew more on business strategy and customer relationship, especially in ecommerce. I might
have no actual contact with their customers but I can see their experience and behaviour through using the store and with that I could improve 
and build better experience for the customer and my client.
