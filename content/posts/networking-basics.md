I had a conversation with a friend about their architectural structure on his work, and he mentioned the word **websocket**. I believe I have encoutered this word many times and I used it on one of my projects but still I don't have the full grasp idea of what is it doing.

**Socket** - A **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Socket** is and endpint instance defined by the combination of IP address with a port, in the context of either a listening state (a server) or a particular TCP Connection (a client, like your browser).

 

**TCP Connection** - pairing of two sockets.

 

**3 main kinds of transports commonly use in browser web apps**

- **XMLHTTPRequests**, or just HTTP for short. Send a single request and get a single response. These are pretty common
- **Server-Sent Events**, or SSE. Send a long-lived request and be able to stream data from the server. Great for real-time data streaming, particularly when the client doesn't need to send messages back to the server.
- **WebSockets**, the only transport that allows for bidirectional streaming of text and binary data. We'll dive a little further into it.

In most tutorials that deal with external data, you'll deal with the left-most paradigm's HTTP requests. Actually, all of these flows are initiated with an HTTP request, as shown by the blue arrows.

I don't commonly see articles or tutorials on SSE, but MDN has a good reference in case a one-way data stream sounds intriguing.

The third flow is most interesting to us - it gives us the ability to communicate with the server over a single long-lived connection.

 

**Use Cases for websockets**

1. Social feeds
2. Multiplayer Games
3. Collaborative Editing/Coding
4. Multimedia Chat
