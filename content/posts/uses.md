I wrote this thing in case I messed up my machine (which is always happens to me ðŸ˜“). I'm using MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)
with 23" AOC I2781FH Full HD IPS.

### Homebrew
To install PHP, MariaDB and other package I need for development. https://brew.sh/
```bash
// PHP
brew install php
```
```bash
// MariaDB
brew install mariadb
brew services start mariadb
```

### Composer
Dependency Manager for PHP. https://getcomposer.org/download/
```bash
// Once the composer has been successfully installed, you can now access composer using
php composer.phar

// To create a shortcut for php composer.phar
Get the directory of `php composer.phar` and then move to bin folder
mv  /Users/meow/composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer 
// After that we can now access the php composer.phar with
composer

// Make sure the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` directory is in your system "PATH"
// On ~/.zshconfig edit the export PATH line
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
```
```bash
https://packagist.org/packages/friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```
