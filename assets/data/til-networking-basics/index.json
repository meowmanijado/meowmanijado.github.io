Send a single request and get a single response. These are pretty common</li>\n<li><strong>Server-Sent Events</strong>, or SSE. Send a long-lived request and be able to stream data from the server. Great for real-time data streaming, particularly when the client doesn't need to send messages back to the server.</li>\n<li><strong>WebSockets</strong>, the only transport that allows for bidirectional streaming of text and binary data. We'll dive a little further into it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ApzTu2NN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/47j90glrwxk8dv2perdp.png\"></p>\n<p>In most tutorials that deal with external data, you'll deal with the left-most paradigm's HTTP requests.
