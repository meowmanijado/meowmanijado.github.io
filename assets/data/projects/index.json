I've started to collaborate with them since 2016, I created\na eCommerce site back then using <strong>WordPress and WooCommerce</strong>. Early 2018 they want to transfer the shop to <strong>Shopify</strong>, because\nthey find it more user friendly and focused on selling.</p>\n<p>I've set-up their store from the start, from store account, theme and importing the products and reviews from wordpress data.\nSince then, I am the maintainer and consultant of their ecommerce store, updating the site information, products, searching\nand finding a ways that can boost sales and customer experience. </p>\n<p>I can say that with collaboration with them, I grew more on business strategy and customer relationship, especially in ecommerce. I might\nhave no actual contact with their customers but I can see their experience and behaviour through using the store and with that I could improve\nand build better experience for the customer and my client.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"","timeToRead":1,"author":{"id":"meow","title":"meow","path":"/author/meow/"}}},{"node":{"id":"c88df58eeed7f9484438d9faf5dcaf54","title":"TIBS","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meowmanijado/meowmanijado.github.io/develop/static/images/posts/TIBS.png","datetime":"2019-06-20 00:00:00","path":"/tibs/","content":"<p>TIBS is a Barangay System tool to manage residents identity and secure information.</p>\n<p><strong>The system is quite basic:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save the resident information</li>\n<li>Print ID of the resident</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's it!</p>\n<p>What I want to cover in this blog is what I unexpected to learn, <strong>communication</strong>.</p>\n<p>Most of the developers, working in a company with a hierarchy, they do the task on bullet basis, this is no exemption of me.\nI'm used to getting the task list and do the coding quick. It gives me more time to think on the code rather than on the\ndomain itself.</p>\n<p>Hence, I got the project with do this, do that, worst is it's just given verbally. Until the project became bulky, there are\nfeatures that the client did'nt want to have in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's the list of what I did:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking ID picture thru webcam (The client wanted it uploadable instead)</li>\n<li>Fingerprint Scanner (The client doesn't need this)</li>\n<li>API of resident info for the mobile app (I don't know what's this for, I bet the client is not aware on this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, the most important thing that did'nt addressed on the early stage: <strong>THE ID PRINTER!</strong></p>\n<p>It's hard to test if we don't have a printer. So the company have decided to bought a ID Printer on the last minute before the deadline. I went a lot of test prints,\npvc cards, and overtime work. </p>\n<p>That was the moment I learned that communication is really vital, if I could have ask the manager\nbefore the project start what is the main purpose of the system, what are the pain points of the client, why we are builiding this, not just getting the task list. If I think beyond the code,\nand get the real purpose, I could lessen the development time and ship the core features of the system early. I learned it\nthe hard way. Never neglect communicating, personally I have tend to focus on the code because \"I'm a programmer\", but coding\nis more than just a code, it is way of communicating to other people, yet in terms of code.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"Barangay ID system tool for residents management and ID printing.","timeToRead":2,"author":{"id":"meow","title":"meow","path":"/author/meow/"}}},{"node":{"id":"787ce1e9bd91a0095843420b92cf251e","title":"Plug It","cover":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meowmanijado/meowmanijado.github.io/develop/static/images/posts/plugit.jpg","datetime":"2019-06-20 00:00:00","path":"/plug-it/","content":"<p>Plug It is a co-working space &#x26; Studio hub for working professionals and university students. </p>\n<p>My friend Chan and ex-colleague has started a business in line of co-working space, he contacted me to\ncreate a system to monitor their daily sales.
