I've started to collaborate with them since 2016, I created\na eCommerce site back then using <strong>WordPress and WooCommerce</strong>. Early 2018 they want to transfer the shop to <strong>Shopify</strong>, because\nthey find it more user friendly and focused on selling.</p>\n<p>I've set-up their store from the start, from store account, theme and importing the products and reviews from wordpress data.\nSince then, I am the maintainer and consultant of their ecommerce store, updating the site information, products, searching\nand finding a ways that can boost sales and customer experience. </p>\n<p>I can say that with collaboration with them, I grew more on business strategy and customer relationship, especially in ecommerce. I might\nhave no actual contact with their customers but I can see their experience and behaviour through using the store and with that I could improve\nand build better experience for the customer and my client.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"","timeToRead":1,"author":{"id":"meow","title":"meow","path":"/author/meow/"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
